# Summary

In this lab we added multi-tenancy support inside of our SaaS application. We introduced the concept of an Identity Provider and its function in underpinning multitenancy, by passing through the user-context – specifically, which tenant they belong to – throughout their session with the application. Finally, we saw how Fauna makes it seamless to implement data isolation, achieving a truly siloed approach to multitenancy.
