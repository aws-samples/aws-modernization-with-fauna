# Onboarding a tenant using the Sign-up application

In the second type of tenant onboarding flow, we'll look at an example wherein tenants can self-register themselves. We've provided a sample solution for that as well so let's check it out.

1. First, log-out of the app (if you're logged-in) by clicking the **Logout** button at the top right hand corner. Then click **Sign in** again to display to sign-in modal. At the bottom of the modal, there's a prompt, "Don't have an account? <a>Signup</a> now." Go ahead and click on the **Signup** button to display the self-registration modal.

    Fill in the form:
   * Enter "tenant2" as the Tenant Name
   * Provide an actual email address where you would be able to receive messages.
   * Address and Phone number can just be dummy values.
   * Pick any Service plan.

2. Click **Save**. If all goes well, a banner will notify you of success. 

Now, let's move on to the next section and review the underlying data-stores to get a better understanding of what happened during the registration processes.
