## Building Serverless SaaS Application with Fauna
[Fauna](https://fauna.com/) is a distributed serverless database sets dev teams free to build faster, scale confidently, and soar above all operational obstacles.

AWS Marketplace accelerates time-to-contract, provides customers with flexible contracts that help them migrate to the cloud, and implements the controls you need to operate with confidence.

## About these labs
The goal of this workshop is to build a multi-tenant Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution using FaunaDB and AWS Serverless Services, such as Amazon API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, AWS Lambda, AWS CodePipeline, Amazon CloudWatch.

By the end of this workshop you will be able to understand the challenges that are unique to a SaaS based delivery, such as onboarding, tenant isolation, data partitioning, tenant deployment pipelines, observability, and how to address them using AWS Serverless services. You will also learn about Fauna’s “parent-child database” feature and Region Groups makes implementation of a silo model (with all its advantages) easy without any of the management trade-offs.
