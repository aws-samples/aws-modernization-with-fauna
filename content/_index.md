## Welcome

In this workshop you will be building a multi-tenant Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution using Fauna and AWS Serverless Services, specifically Amazon API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, AWS Lambda, AWS CodePipeline, and Amazon CloudWatch. We will provide the sample code and reference architecture; And we walk you through the entire solution. The goal is to provide an understanding of serverless architecture as it apples to multi-tenancy, and introduce
Fauna features/functionality that make them seamless to implement. 

This workshop is a fork of the [SaaS Factory Serverless SaaS reference solution](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-saas-factory-ref-solution-serverless-saas), combined with Fauna concepts. The combination produces an architecture
that's both scalable yet highly flexible (at the database layer), allowing requirements to effortlessly change over
time, while providing the best developer experience.
